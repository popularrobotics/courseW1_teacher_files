# TROUBLESHOOTING:
#	  Don't use Ctrl+Z to stop the program, use Ctrl+c.
#	  If you use Ctrl+Z, it will not close the socket and you won't be able to run the program the next time.
#	  If you get the following error:
#		  "socket.error: [Errno 98] Address already in use "
#	  Run this on the terminal:
#		  "sudo netstat -ap |grep :9093"
#	  Note down the PID of the process running it
#	  And kill that process using:
#		  "kill pid"
#	  If it does not work use:
#		  "kill -9 pid"
#	  If the error does not go away, try changin the port number '9093' both in the client and server code
