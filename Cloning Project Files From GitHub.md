# Cloning Project Files From GitHub
This tutorial shows you how to clone the whole project/course repository from GitHub. Authorization required.

## STEPS
1. Connect your device to the Internet;
2. Log onto github.com and get the repository URL;
3. Open a terminal on your device;
4. In the terminal, use `cd` command to change the directory to where you want to store your project;
5. In the terminal, type in the following command and hit 'enter';
```
git clone repository_URL
```
6. Type in your github username and password if prompted.
7. Once done cloning, there'll be a folder under the directory you chose that stores all files from the github repository, and the folder name would be the same as the repository name. Now you can `cd` to your project folder and use all other git commands.
