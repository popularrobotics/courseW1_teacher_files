# courseW1_teacher_files

## Overview
This repository contains all program files and tutorials for school teachers for Course W1. The `src` folder in this repo contains files that need to be put under the `/home/ubuntu/ProjectName_ws/src/package_name/src` folder once you set up a ROS workspace on your robot. Clone this repository to your robot, and follow the tutorials on robociti.com (or below) to create your own ROS workspace, and make the robot run!


## Walking Through The Files In The Workspace
It is recommended to read through the following tutorials in the order they are listed.

### 1. Setting Up Your Raspberry Pi Board
This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up your RPi board and installing the operating system.

### 2. Cloning Project Files From GitHub

### 3. Ubuntu & ROS Basics
This tutorial contains the basic knowledge about Ubuntu and ROS that are needed for this course.

### 4. Introduction to Python
This tutorial contains the basic knowledge about Python that are needed for this course.

### 5. Running a Script Automatically Upon Startup
This tutorial shows you how to configure the system to make a script run automatically upon system startup, which will be quite useful at the last session of this course - autonomous driving challenge.

### 6. Setting Up Remote Control
This tutorial shows you how to set static IP, connect your phone or laptop to the robot wirelessly, and control the motors remotely.

### * Python Scripts Under the 'src' Folder  
- **course_w1.py** is the only script students should edit and play with.
- **course_w1_cheatsheet.py** contains functions written by instructors, including the autonomous driving function. Instructors can write functions here for students to refer to. It's a cheatsheet. Students should try to complete the challenge on their own  before checking out this file.
- **course_w1_remote_control.py** enables the robot to be controled remotely, which can be used to check whether the robot has been correctly assembled.


## Notice
Do not modify any files other than **course_w1.py**, unless instructed otherwise.
